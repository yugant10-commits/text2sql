## Algorithm for SQL Generation  

This approach follows a two-step SQL generation technique, loosely inspired by the [RSL-SQL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00073).  

However, several enhancements have been made to adapt it to this context, leveraging the latest techniques, such as OpenAI‚Äôs `response_format` (also supported by other LLMs).  

### Steps in the Algorithm  

1. **System Prompt Building**  
   - Constructs the system prompt for both the first and second API calls.  
   - The structure follows the diagram below.  

2. **Response Formatting**  
   - Ensures structured output to guide the second API call in the right direction.  
   - Includes:  
     - A rephrased query considering the background information.  
     - A list of required tables for generating the SQL query.  

3. **Second API Call (SQL Generation)**  
   - Uses the JSON output from the first call as the user query input.  
   - Includes additional context:  
     - Database schema  
     - Database snapshots (to ensure consistency)  

4. **SQL Query Validation**  
   - Rule-based validation via string manipulation and regex.  
   - **Only** `SELECT` statements are allowed; others raise an issue.  
   - All queries are limited to `LIMIT 10` to prevent excessive data exposure in the UI.
